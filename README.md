# Prework Study Guide

## Description

It's important not only to watch videos and hear lessons, but to actively participate and work with what you're learning. It helps to trap things in the noggin'

While learning from the Prework course, I wanted to encorporate some little tips and notes as a sort of study-guide that I could refer to while working on projects. Hopefully, it will be useful to some of you!
